# Bruteworld
## A bruteforce program
### How it works
#### Scratch
This program generates a password from 8 charecters to 25 charecters, then tries to login using the generated password.
<br>If the password doesn't work, it will make a new one and will repeat this process until it guesses the password correct.
#### Test
The test option works very similarly to the Scratchâ„¢ bruteforce except it has it's own temporary database.
### License
The license is in the file `LICENSE.md`, that's all.
### Why this program was made
This program was made to get the password of a friend, his brother found his password and changed it, and because he didn't enter a recovery email, I made **_this_**
